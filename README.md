# Rust Drivers for Linux

This repository contains the source code for the Rust drivers for Linux. The drivers are written in Rust and are built using the Linux kernel build system.


This is just the layer for educatoin purposes, I build it in tree and copy the important files here for education,
maybe in the future I will try to make it out of tree while including all the work already done by the rust-for-linux team.
